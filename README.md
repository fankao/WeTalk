## Project Description
Our chat application is a scalable, performant, reliable, and secure application that allows users to create and join chat rooms, send and receive messages, see who is participating in each chat room, and more. The application also supports user registration, which allows us to collect user information, such as their name, email address, and password. This information is used to authenticate users and authorize them to access resources in the application.
The chat application is built on a layered architecture with an event-driven messaging system. It uses Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, and MySQL.
The application supports the following features:
- Create and join chat rooms
- Send and receive messages
- See who is participating in each chat room
- File attachments
- Offline messaging
- Notifications
- Search 
- User registration 

The chat application is still under development, but it is already usable. We are open to contributions from the community. 

To contribute to the development of the application, you can submit pull requests to the GitHub repository.

**Additional Notes**

In addition to the features listed above, we are also considering adding the following features to the chat application in the future:
- Video and audio calling 
- Group chats 
- Private messaging 
- Chat history 
- Admin tools

We are also open to suggestions from the community for other features that would be useful in a chat application.
